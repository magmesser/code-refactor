# Code Refactor Starter Code


## Description

This project tested the skills to refactor code from an existing starter code.  By cleaning and consolidating the html and css code it allowed me as a student to improve my understanding of html semantics.  When changing the html elements, it broke the corresponding css elements.  I then had to analyze the css file to troubleshoot why it was not working as it had before.  I appreciated the real-world feel that this practice provided. :tada:
